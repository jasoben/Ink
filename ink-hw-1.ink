// To be completed after you have played/read both "about ink" files

Here is an Ink file with many problems. Please fix them and write in a comment how you did so. The comment can be very brief, for instance:
\/\/ This Knot didn't go anywhere, so I added a Divert.  
Ok, on to the challenges. You will need to read the text and discern what the "novice programmer" is trying to do, then fix their code, with comments. 

* This is a choice 
* This is a sub-choice of the first choice 
Some stuff happens if you choose this. 
    * * Here is another sub-choice of that first choice
    Some other stuff happens. 
        * * * And here is a third, with it's own sub-choices. 
            * * * * * sub-sub-choice! 
            * * * * * sub-sub-choice number two!

Now that you've made your choice, we can continue with the main story. 


=== the main story ===

Once upon a time, there was a dog. That dog wanted to learn to fly. You see, it really liked crepes. But only in Paris. 

You can undestand it's conundrum. 

* Tell me more about the dog -> about_the_dog 

- I'll happily tell you more about the dog! 

=== about_the_dog ===

The thing is, you are the dog. You have options. What do you do?

* Walk the 20 miles to the airport and bark at somebody near a plane -> bark_at_somebody 
* Use your paws to ask ChatGPT "What should a dog do to learn to fly?" -> ask_chat_GPT 
* You learn [to enjoy] dog food.-> dog_food


=== the_airport ===

= bark_at_somebody 
You go to the airport and bark at a man wearing a bright vest. 

= just_get_into_an_open_cockpit_and_wing_it
You get into an open cockpit and "wing" it. 
-> catastrophe 

=== dog_food ===

Really this was the only rational answer. The end.

= catastrophe =

Oh no! They found you. You get a pet and your human comes pick you up. You must learn to love dog_food, I guess.
