Roll the Calamity Die. If you get a 4 or 5, nothing happens. Otherwise...

1. A character becomes frustrated with us
2. Quantum weirdness causes a random aberation in the timeline
3. The Powers That Be deny a previously granted Free Will Request; a random choice is eliminated and cannot be replaced
